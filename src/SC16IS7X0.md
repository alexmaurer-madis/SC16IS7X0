This file (which I do not guarantee error free) is a quick reference guide to help me writing this library.
The base document I used is the *NXP PDF Rev.7 - 9 June 2011.*

# Power-up sequence
- After power is applied, the device is reset by the internal POR. The host must wait at least
3us before initializing a communication with the device.

- The host processor must wait until the crystal is generating a stable clock before accessing
the UART transmitter or receiver.

- Normally, if an external clock such as a system clock or an external oscillator is used to
supply a clock to XTAL1 pin, the clock should be stable at this time.

- When using a crystal, the start-up time depends on the crystal being used, VCC ramp-up time and the
loading capacitor values. The start-up time can be as long as a few milliseconds.

# Sleep mode
**NOT PROGRAMMED YET*
- PDF Page 17
- Sleep mode is enabled with IER[4]
  - IER Register is only accessible when Enhanced Functions EFR[4] is enabled.
    - EFR Register is only accessible when LCR = 0xBF.
- In sleep mode the clock to the UART is stopped
- Sleep Mode is entered when :
  - The serial data input line, RX, is idle
  - The TX FIFO and TX shift register are empty
  - There are no interrupts pending except THR
- The UART will wake up :
  - When any change is detected on the RX line
  - Any change in the state of the modem inputs pins
  - Or data is written to the TX FIFO

# Programmable baudrate generator
- Clock input can be divided in the range between 1 and 65535
- An additional divide-by-4 prescaler is also available and can be selected by MCR[7]
  - MCR[7] is only writable when EFR[4] is set
    - EFR is only accessible when LCR is set to 0xBF
- Divisor formula is (XTAL1 freq / prescaler) / (Desired baudrate x 16)
  - Example for 115'200bps with a clock of 1.8432MHz
    - (1843200 / 1) / (115200 x 16) = 1
    - Divisor 1, no remainder, baudrate frequency is bang-on !

## Division Register (DLL, DLH)
- PDF Page 31
- These are two 8-bit registers which store the 16-bit divisor
- DLL and DLH accessible only when LCR[7] is logic 1.
- DLL and DLH can only be written to before Sleep mode is enabled (before IER[4] is set)

## Changing prescaler
- Set LCR to 0xBF, now EFR Register is accessible
- Set EFR[4] to 1, enhanced functions are now accessible
- Set MCR[7]
  - To 0 for divide-by-1
  - To 1 for divide-by-4
